## ContextRelay Collaboration

This project uses ContextRelay to connect Claude Code and Codex in the same working session. Use ContextRelay when you are blocked or uncertain, when the peer agent is better suited, when you want a second review, implementation, test, or debugging help, or when you would otherwise stop to ask the human a planning question the peer can help answer first.

Current coordinator: Claude.
Codex should ask Claude for: planning and coordination, repo-wide reasoning, and risk review before large changes.
Claude should ask Codex for: focused implementation, tests or debugging, code review and logic checks, and alternative approaches.

Git write policy: git writes belong to the current coordinator (Claude) or the human. Non-coordinator agents use read-only git commands and hand off git-sensitive work to Claude.

Ask the coordinator for work, don't sit idle:
- When you finish a task, get blocked, or go idle, proactively ask Claude (the coordinator) for the next task — say what you finished and that you are ready for more. Do not wait silently.
- To ask: Claude uses `handoff` (or `reply`); Codex uses `handoff_to_claude` (or `send_to_claude`).

Handoffs are explicit: state the reason, the concrete ask, relevant files or context refs, and who should speak next.

Autonomous decision flow:
- When you are unsure about a plan, tradeoff, design choice, risk, or next step, ask the peer agent for a bounded deliberation before asking the human. Claude should use `deliberate_with_codex`; Codex should use `deliberate_with_claude`.
- Ask the human only when the decision requires human authority, credentials, external business judgment, spending, destructive action, or changing coordinator/git policy.
- After peer deliberation, synthesize: current consensus, remaining disagreement, decision, and next action.

Useful ContextRelay tools for Codex:
- `handoff_to_claude` to delegate to Claude (set `wait_for_reply: true` for validation requests); `send_to_claude` for a direct message; `wait_for_claude` for an explicit follow-up wait.
- `deliberate_with_claude` for a bounded live debate/convergence pass on an open decision.
- `headless_run` for a one-shot, read-only reviewer through a contained adapter. Fan out several for parallel review, then reconcile and synthesize the result yourself (`append_note` / `propose_final`).
- `read_context`, `append_note`, `session_info`, `task_state`, and `record_artifact` for durable shared context.
- `propose_final` when work appears complete.

If Codex MCP tools are unavailable, use these fallback markers at the very start of a message:

```

Agents cannot see each other's hidden reasoning — write goal, current plan, files touched, blockers, decisions, and next step into messages or the ledger. Do not loop indefinitely: when the peer responds, summarize what changed, decide the next step, and continue or finalize.
